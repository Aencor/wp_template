**WORDPRESS CUSTOM THEME BOILERPLATE**

This WP Theme Boilerplate works for starting a new WP Site from scratch with some tools that you may find useful

On the Plugins side you'll find :

**ACF PRO**  [https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) 
**WP ALL IN ONE MIGRATION WITH EXTENSIONS**  
**W3 TOTAL CACHE**  
 **WEBP EXPRESS**  
 **CONTACT FORM 7**  
 **YOAST SEO**  
 **DUPLICATE POST**  
 **WORDFENCE**  
 **UNDER CONSTRUCTION PAGE**
 
 Now the theme Supports ACF Update with LOCAL JSON, very useful when working on Local Environments and then uploading to staging, just hve to sync changes once you upload your files.
 
 The functions have been completely rewritten in order to allow you to find more easily the functions you need.
 
 The SCSS folder have been also updated to be more organized, and let you expand your CSS with ease.

I've included some Libraries that I find very useful

**BOOTSTRAP**  
**GSAP**  [https://greensock.com/gsap/](https://greensock.com/gsap/)  
**FONT AWESOME**  [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/)  
**ANIMATE CSS**

This theme uses **SASS** and you cand use the "base" file located on 'assets/css/_base.scss and edit the style.scss right away, but sure if you don't know how to use sass I highly recommend you to check it out [here](https://sass-lang.com/)
